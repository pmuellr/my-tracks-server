%PROGRAM% - %DESCRIPTION%

This program is an HTTP server which provides a web application displaying
GPS tracks and associated goodies.

usage:

    %PROGRAM% [options] git-url

where

    git-url - is the url of the git repo containing the track data

options:

    -g --git-webhook <secret>  secret for a git webhook
    -f --flickr <api-key>      Flickr API key
    -p --port <number>         http port to run on
    -v --verbose
    -h --help

The git webhook secret is a string which is used with the server's
`/api/webhooks/git` endpoint, to trigger a rebuild of the server data based
on a git push.  The secret is used to validate the `X-Hub-Signature`
header, per the [github webooks documentation][].  Webhooks can be configured
at your GitHub project's "Settings" page.  The only webhook event that
triggers a rebuild is the `push` event.

The [flickr api key] is a key obtained from flickr, which allows the application
to perform APIs against flickr.

You can also set the git-webhook secret and flickr key via environment variable
or Cloud Foundry [user-provided service][].  The service names are matched via
regular expression (first match wins, so ... indeterminate if multiple), and
expect a particular credential property name in the service.  Values are:

    option             env var        service name regex    credential name
    -------------      -------        ------------------    ---------------
    --flickr           FLICKR         /.*flickr.*/          api-key
    --git-webhook      GIT_WEBHOOK    /.*git-webhook.*/     secret

For instance, to set the flickr api key to "ABCD", you can either set the
environment variable `FLICKR` to `ABCD`, or create a user-provided service via

    cf cups flickr -p api-key

This will prompt you for the api key, and then create a service named `flickr`,
which you can bind to your app.

Command line options override environment variable settings override
user-provided services.
